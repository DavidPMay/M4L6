//Challenge
//
//Build an app that displays information about people working at different companies. The main view has two tabs:
//
//The first tab shows a list of all the people, including their name, address, company and number of years of experience
//
//The second tab has some toggles that let users change what information is displayed in the list
//
//To do this, build a view model that holds a list of people and the current userâ€™s preferences. Access the model in the views by using the EnvironmentObject modifier.
